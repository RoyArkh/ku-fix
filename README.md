# ku-fix

This Chrome extension automatically converts any links on **https://learn.hub.ku.edu.tr/** into non-forcing, allowing PDFs and other files to open directly in the browser instead of being downloaded. KU Learn’s new interface often forces downloads for readings and assignments, cluttering my computer with unnecessary files. Let's be real, you dont even read any of those files.
